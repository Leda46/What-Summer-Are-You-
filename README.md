## Devlogs, Inspiration and Process: 

I didn’t post any devlogs for this project because it’s my first one for the event, and I knew I could finish it in under 10 hours. 
I now understand the value of devlogs and will definitely use them for future projects!

This quiz was inspired by classic Buzzfeed-style personality tests, which I always found fun and engaging. Of course, these kinds of 
quizzes aren’t meant to be super accurate — they’re just lighthearted and entertaining. I made it summer-themed because… well, it’s summer!


To start, I brainstormed quiz questions, options, and personality types (with help from AI). Then, I had AI help me build the initial 
code structure — including basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with some function stubs to organize the logic. From there, I added my own 
custom logic, expanded the functionality, and polished the design to match my vision.
